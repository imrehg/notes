=== Reorganize MOT beams ===

From the current "+" arrangement of the beams we have to move to the
more convenient "x" arrangement. This can be done only when I know
that the MOT is working well, since I have to check the alignment of
the beams.

The "x" arrangement will allow more space for the detection system,
and would leave two sides of the system open for the experimental beams.

The disadvantage is the larger scattering pattern on the glass cell
side, which has to be taken into account. If **w** is the beam radius
and **d** is the cell radius on the short end, then **w 2^(1/2) < d**.

== Use larger beam spot size ==

Larger beam spot size woulf enable us to have larger MOT. According to the papers, the MOT size scales  better with the beam size than with the beam intensity, and almost always advantageous to create large beams. Also, beam alignment is much less painful and more robust with a larger beam.

Our current contraint is to do with the l/2 and l/4 plates. They are 1/2" optics thus doesn't allow much larger than the current x4 magnification (200mm & -50mm lens pair). The current spot size is on the order of w = 3.5mm.

To be able to do this, we need lenses with longer focal length (have a 250mm and a 300mm lens, that should be good enough). Additionally, we need different mounts for the 1" optics. This still has to be manufactured. The waveplates then can be aligned with the help of a PBS cube, and made ready to use.

== Geometric alignment of beams ==

The 6 trapping beams have to be quite well aligned to be able to observe the MOT, especially because of the relative small size of the beams. This, however, is difficult because the geometrical arrangement does not lend itself to easy positioning of the beams. The magnetic coil holders have machining imperfections that break symmetry (e.g. the hole in the middle is not cental with respect to the frame, since one side of the frame is longer). When going perpendicular to the glass walls ("+" beams), the arrangement is much simpler. The "x" configuration seems to have to rely on lot of trial-and-error, which is time consuming and error-prone. Especially difficult when there's no visible fluorescence to guide us. Maybe it's better to get some fluorescence first and then try to arrange things again? A possible disadvantage is the need to wait for pumping out afterwards, which can take days...

=== Relocate Repumper laser ===

The idea to relocate the repumper laser to join the slave laser comes
from the current difficulties with the optical feedback due to the
FC/PC ended fibre. The advantages, though are multifold:

* Could overlap with the master laser before injecting into a fibre,
thus allowing for simpler alingment at the trap.
* The overlap can happen before an AOM, thus shifting the repumper
frequency to a suitable one.
* Optical feedback can be reduced with the AOM (hopefully).
* Switching is possible.

**Now thinking about it**, since we have 2 AOMs, only the aligment
is the serious advantage, everything else can be done with 2 
separate AOM configurations , using the same frequency 
source. (x2 double pass, or x1 single-pass (repumper) + x1 double-pass 
(master))

=== x2 single pass AOM ===

Overlaping of the master and the repumper beam can happen between the 
two AOMs on a PBS cube. 

* D_slave_aom = 75.8 MHz ( = frequency diff between F=3->2x3 and F=3->3 
transitions).
* 2 * D_slave_aom + 2 * Gamma = 161.6 MHz = D_master_aom

The driver would be the same for both, using a power splitter 
(MiniCircuit) and two +10dB amplifiers. I already have the amplifiers, 
the new one would be switched out from the master system EOM amplifier, 
which is replaced by an unused "home-made-box" version.

=== Reroute master locking system ===

If we go with two double-pass system, it is not necessarry.

Otherwise, if we use the x2 single-pass AOM:

* Using +1 order of AOM instead of -1 for the locking beam, to have the 
right frequency shift for the repumper.

Could also consider using -1 order for the injection beam instead of the 
0 order, to be able to reduce power and thus optical feedback from the 
master. Would need an additional L/2 plate for the master locking 
system to have the same power for different AOM drive power.

=== Optical detection system ===

Design and order parts. Ideas:

* Dichroic mirror to separate IR and VIS (7P1/2 ~ 454 nm) light. **Casix**
* Two PD, preferably x1 Si (IR), x1 GaP (VIS)


Professor's idea:

* PMT system for high sensitivity
* IMHO lacks diagnostics, slower, more space needed, scattered 
light sensitivity

=== Labeling of power supply ===

The switches sould be labelled according to connections, to document 
conenctions and avoid mistakes.

* x2 slave AOM amp
* x1 master EOM amp

**Update:** Done.

=== Fan extension cord ===

There are a number of fans used to cool my amplifiers (right now 4). 
They should be plugged into an "unpriviliged" socket, not to the  
regulated/laser/UPS ones. Also, a cord would allow quick and 1-step 
swithcing, for power saving, safety reasons. There might be other 
non-critical equipment added: CCD camera?

**Update:** Done, all amplifier fans are on a same cord connecting to the external power network.
